Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book
[*Clean Code*](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882),
adapted for JavaScript. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
readable, reusable, and refactorable software in JavaScript. Enjoy!

## **Variables**
### Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

**Bad:**
```javascript
var yyyymmdstr = moment().format('YYYY/MM/DD');
```

**Good**:
```javascript
var yearMonthDay = moment().format('YYYY/MM/DD');
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable

**Bad:**
```javascript
getUserInfo();
getClientData();
getCustomerRecord();
```

**Good**:
```javascript
getUser();
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use searchable names
We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we do write is readable and searchable. By *not* naming variables that end up being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers. Make your names searchable.

**Bad:**
```javascript
// What the heck is 525600 for?
for (var i = 0; i < 525600; i++) {
  runCronJob();
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
// Declare them as capitalized `var` globals.
var MINUTES_IN_A_YEAR = 525600;
for (var i = 0; i < MINUTES_IN_A_YEAR; i++) {
  runCronJob();
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Mental Mapping
Explicit is better than implicit.

**Bad:**
```javascript
var locations = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];
locations.forEach((l) => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  ...
  ...
  ...
  // Wait, what is `l` for again?
  dispatch(l);
});
```

**Good**:
```javascript
var locations = ['Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco'];
locations.forEach((location) => {
  doStuff();
  doSomeOtherStuff();
  ...
  ...
  ...
  dispatch(location);
});
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't add unneeded context
If your class/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your
variable name.

**Bad:**
```javascript
var Car = {
  carMake: 'Honda',
  carModel: 'Accord',
  carColor: 'Blue'
};

function paintCar(car) {
  car.carColor = 'Red';
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
var Car = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Accord',
  color: 'Blue'
};

function paintCar(car) {
  car.color = 'Red';
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Short-circuiting is cleaner than conditionals

**Bad:**
```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  var breweryName;
  if (name) {
    breweryName = name;
  } else {
    breweryName = 'Hipster Brew Co.';
  }
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  var breweryName = name || 'Hipster Brew Co.'
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## **Functions**
### Limit the amount of function parameters (2 or less)
Use an object if you are finding yourself needing a lot of parameters.

**Bad:**
```javascript
function createMenu(title, body, buttonText, cancellable) {
  ...
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
var menuConfig = {
  title: 'Foo',
  body: 'Bar',
  buttonText: 'Baz'
  cancellable: true
}

function createMenu(config) {
  ...
}

```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**


### Functions should do one thing
This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, they can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**
```javascript
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    let clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    emailClientIfNeeded();
  });
}

function emailClientIfNeeded(client) {
  if (isClientActive(client)) {
    email(client);
  }
}

function isClientActive(client) {
  let clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
  return clientRecord.isActive();
}
```

### Remove duplicate code
Never ever, ever, under any circumstance, have duplicate code. There's no reason
for it and it's quite possibly the worst sin you can commit as a professional
developer. Duplicate code means there's more than one place to alter something
if you need to change some logic. JavaScript is untyped, so it makes having
generic functions quite easy. Take advantage of that!

**Bad:**
```javascript
function showDeveloperList(developers) {
  developers.forEach(developers => {
    var expectedSalary = developer.calculateExpectedSalary();
    var experience = developer.getExperience();
    var githubLink = developer.getGithubLink();
    var data = {
      expectedSalary: expectedSalary,
      experience: experience,
      githubLink: githubLink
    };

    render(data);
  });
}

function showManagerList(managers) {
  managers.forEach(manager => {
    var expectedSalary = manager.calculateExpectedSalary();
    var experience = manager.getExperience();
    var portfolio = manager.getMBAProjects();
    var data = {
      expectedSalary: expectedSalary,
      experience: experience,
      portfolio: portfolio
    };

    render(data);
  });
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
function showList(employees) {
  employees.forEach(employee => {
    var expectedSalary = employee.calculateExpectedSalary();
    var experience = employee.getExperience();
    var portfolio;

    if (employee.type === 'manager') {
      portfolio = employee.getMBAProjects();
    } else {
      portfolio = employee.getGithubLink();
    }

    var favoriteManagerBooks = getMBAList()
    var data = {
      expectedSalary: expectedSalary,
      experience: experience,
      portfolio: portfolio
    };

    render(data);
  });
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting
**Bad:**
```javascript
function writeForumComment(subject, body) {
  subject = subject || 'No Subject';
  body = body || 'No text';
}

```

**Good**:
```javascript
function writeForumComment(subject='No subject', body='No text') {
  ...
}

```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Set default objects with Object.assign

**Bad:**
```javascript
var menuConfig = {
  title: null,
  body: 'Bar',
  buttonText: null
  cancellable: true
}

function createMenu(config) {
  config.title = config.title || 'Foo'
  config.body = config.body || 'Bar'
  config.buttonText = config.title || 'Baz'
  config.cancellable = config.cancellable === undefined ? config.cancellable : true;

}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```

**Good**:
```javascript
var menuConfig = {
  title: null,
  body: 'Bar',
  buttonText: null
  cancellable: true
}

function createMenu(config) {
  Object.assign(config, {
    title: 'Foo',
    body: 'Bar',
    buttonText: 'Baz',
    cancellable: true
  });
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**


### Don't use flags as function parameters
Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions should do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths based on a boolean.

**Bad:**
```javascript
function createFile(name, temp) {
  if (temp) {
    fs.create('./temp/' + name);
  } else {
    fs.create(name);
  }
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
function createTempFile(name) {
  fs.create('./temp/' + name);
}

function createFile(name) {
  fs.create(name);
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid Side Effects
A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in
and return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file,
modifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a
Nigerian prince.

Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous
example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to
centralize where you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes
that write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.

The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects
without any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,
and not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will
be happier than the vast majority of other programmers.

**Bad:**
```javascript
// Global variable referenced by following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it could break it.
var name = 'Ryan McDermott';

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {
  name = name.split(' ');
}

console.log(name); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```

**Good**:
```javascript
function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name) {
  return name.split(' ');
}

var name = 'Ryan McDermott'
var newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name);

console.log(name); // 'Ryan McDermott';
console.log(newName); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't write to global functions
Polluting globals is a bad practice in JavaScript because you could clash with another
library and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an
exception in production. Let's think about an example: what if you wanted to
extend JavaScript's native Array method to have a `diff` method that could
show the difference between two arrays? You could write your new function
to the `Array.prototype`, but it could clash with another library that tried
to do the same thing. What if that other library was just using `diff` to find
the difference between the first and last elements of an array? This is why it
would be much better to just use ES6 classes and simply extend the `Array` global.

**Bad:**
```javascript
Array.prototype.diff = function(comparisonArray) {
  var values = [];
  var hash = {};

  for (var i of comparisonArray) {
    hash[i] = true;
  }

  for (var i of this) {
    if (!hash[i]) {
      values.push(i);
    }
  }

  return values;
}
```

**Good:**
```javascript
class SuperArray extends Array {
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);
  }

  diff(comparisonArray) {
    var values = [];
    var hash = {};

    for (var i of comparisonArray) {
      hash[i] = true;
    }

    for (var i of this) {
      if (!hash[i]) {
        values.push(i);
      }
    }

    return values;
  }
}
```

### Favor functional programming over imperative programming
If Haskell were an IPA then JavaScript would be an O'Douls. That is to say,
JavaScript isn't a functional language in the way that Haskell is, but it has
a functional flavor to it. Functional languages are cleaner and easier to test.
Favor this style of programming when you can.

**Bad:**
```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: 'Uncle Bobby',
    linesOfCode: 500
  }, {
    name: 'Suzie Q',
    linesOfCode: 1500
  }, {
    name: 'Jimmy Gosling',
    linesOfCode: 150
  }, {
    name: 'Gracie Hopper',
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

var totalOutput = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < programmerOutput.length; i++) {
  totalOutput += programmerOutput[i].linesOfCode;
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: 'Uncle Bobby',
    linesOfCode: 500
  }, {
    name: 'Suzie Q',
    linesOfCode: 1500
  }, {
    name: 'Jimmy Gosling',
    linesOfCode: 150
  }, {
    name: 'Gracie Hopper',
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

var totalOutput = programmerOutput
  .map((programmer) => programmer.linesOfCode)
  .reduce((acc, linesOfCode) => acc + linesOfCode, 0);
```

### Avoid conditionals
This seems like an impossible task. Upon first hearing this, most people say,
"how am I supposed to do anything without an `if` statement?" The answer is that
you can use polymorphism to achieve the same task in many cases. The second
question is usually, "well that's great but why would I want to do that?" The
answer is a previous clean code concept we learned: a function should only do
one thing. When you have classes and functions that have `if` statements, you
are telling your user that your function does more than one thing. Remember,
just do one thing.

**Bad:**
```javascript
class Airplane {
  //...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    switch (this.type) {
      case '777':
        return getMaxAltitude() - getPassengerCount();
      case 'Air Force One':
        return getMaxAltitude();
      case 'Cesna':
        return getMaxAltitude() - getFuelExpenditure();
    }
  }
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
class Airplane {
  //...
}

class Boeing777 extends Airplane {
  //...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    return getMaxAltitude() - getPassengerCount();
  }
}

class AirForceOne extends Airplane {
  //...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    return getMaxAltitude();
  }
}

class Cesna extends Airplane {
  //...
  getCruisingAltitude() {
    return getMaxAltitude() - getFuelExpenditure();
  }
}
```

### Avoid type-checking (part 1)
JavaScript is untyped, which means your functions can take any type of argument.
Sometimes you are bitten by this freedom and it becomes tempting to do
type-checking in your functions. There are many ways to avoid having to do this.
The first thing to consider is consistent APIs.

**Bad:**
```javascript
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  if (obj instanceof Bicylce) {
    vehicle.peddle(this.currentLocation, new Location('texas'));
  } else if (obj instanceof Car) {
    vehicle.drive(this.currentLocation, new Location('texas'));
  }
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  vehicle.move(this.currentLocation, new Location('texas'));
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Avoid type-checking (part 2)
If you are working with basic primitive values like strings, integers, and arrays,
and you can't use polymorphism but you still feel the need to type-check,
you should consider using TypeScript. It is an excellent alternative to normal
JavaScript, as it provides you with static typing on top of standard JavaScript
syntax. The problem with manually type-checking normal JavaScript is that
doing it well requires so much extra verbiage that the faux "type-safety" you get
doesn't make up for the lost readability. Keep your JavaScript, clean, write
good tests, and have good code reviews. Otherwise, do all of that but with
TypeScript (which, like I said, is a great alternative!).

**Bad:**
```javascript
function combine(val1, val2) {
  if (typeof val1 == "number" && typeof val2 == "number" ||
      typeof val1 == "string" && typeof val2 == "string") {
    return val1 + val2;
  } else {
    throw new Error('Must be of type String or Number');
  }
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
function combine(val1, val2) {
  return val1 + val2;
}
```

### Don't over-optimize
Modern browsers do a lot of optimization under-the-hood at runtime. A lot of
times, if you are optimizing then you are just wasting your time. [There are good
resources](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers)
for seeing where optimization is lacking. Target those in the meantime, until
they are fixed if they can be.

**Bad:**
```javascript

// On old browsers, each iteration would be costly because `len` would be
// recomputed. In modern browsers, this is optimized.
for (var i = 0, len = list.length; i < len; i++) {
  // ...
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
  // ...
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**


## **Objects and Data Structures**
### Use getters and setters
JavaScript doesn't have interfaces or types so it is very hard to enforce this
pattern, because we don't have keywords like `public` and `private`. As it is,
using getters and setters to access data on objects if far better than simply
looking for a property on an object. "Why?" you might ask. Well, here's an
unorganized list of reasons why:

1. When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have
to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
2. Makes adding validation simple when doing a `set`.
3. Encapsulates the internal representation.
4. Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.
5. Inheriting this class, you can override default functionality.
6. You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a
server.


**Bad:**
```javascript
class BankAccount {
  constructor() {
	   this.balance = 1000;
  }
}

let bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Buy shoes...
bankAccount.balance = bankAccount.balance - 100;
```

**Good**:
```javascript
class BankAccount {
  constructor() {
	   this.balance = 1000;
  }

  // It doesn't have to be prefixed with `get` or `set` to be a getter/setter
  withdraw(amount) {
  	if (verifyAmountCanBeDeducted(amount)) {
  	  this.balance -= amount;
  	}
  }
}

let bankAccount = new BankAccount();

// Buy shoes...
bankAccount.withdraw(100);
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**


### Make objects have private members
This can be accomplished through closures (for ES5 and below).

**Bad:**
```javascript

var Employee = function(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Employee.prototype.getName = function() {
  return this.name;
}

var employee = new Employee('John Doe');
console.log('Employee name: ' + employee.getName()); // Employee name: John Doe
delete employee.name;
console.log('Employee name: ' + employee.getName()); // Employee name: undefined
```

**Good**:
```javascript
var Employee = (function() {
  function Employee(name) {
    this.getName = function() {
      return name;
    };
  }

  return Employee;
}());

var employee = new Employee('John Doe');
console.log('Employee name: ' + employee.getName()); // Employee name: John Doe
delete employee.name;
console.log('Employee name: ' + employee.getName()); // Employee name: John Doe
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**


## **Classes**
### Classes should obey Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
As stated in Clean Code, "There should never be more than one reason for a class
to change". It's tempting to jam-pack a class with a lot of functionality, like
when you can only take one suitcase on your flight. The issue with this is
that your class won't be conceptually cohesive and it will give it many reasons
to change. Minimizing the amount of times you need to change a class is important.
It's important because if too much functioanlity is in one class and you modify a piece of it,
it can be difficult to understand how that will affect other dependent modules in
your codebase.

**Bad:**
```javascript
class UserSettings {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user;
  }

  changeSettings(settings) {
    if (this.verifyCredentials(user)) {
      // ...
    }
  }

  verifyCredentials(user) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
class UserAuth {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user;
  }

  verifyCredentials() {
    // ...
  }
}


class UserSettings {
  constructor(user) {
    this.user = user;
    this.auth = new UserAuth(user)
  }

  changeSettings(settings) {
    if (this.auth.verifyCredentials()) {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Prefer ES6 classes over ES5 plain functions
It's very difficult to get readable class inheritance, construction, and method
definitions for classical ES5 classes. If you need inheritance (and be aware
that you might not), then prefer classes. However, prefer small functions over
classes until you find yourself needing larger and more complex objects.

**Bad:**
```javascript
var Animal = function(age) {
    if (!(this instanceof Animal)) {
        throw new Error("Instantiate Animal with `new`");
    }

    this.age = age;
};

Animal.prototype.move = function() {};

var Mammal = function(age, furColor) {
    if (!(this instanceof Mammal)) {
        throw new Error("Instantiate Mammal with `new`");
    }

    Animal.call(this, age);
    this.furColor = furColor;
};

Mammal.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Mammal.prototype.constructor = Mammal;
Mammal.prototype.liveBirth = function() {};

var Human = function(age, furColor, languageSpoken) {
    if (!(this instanceof Human)) {
        throw new Error("Instantiate Human with `new`");
    }

    Mammal.call(this, age, furColor);
    this.languageSpoken = languageSpoken;
};

Human.prototype = Object.create(Mammal.prototype);
Human.prototype.constructor = Human;
Human.prototype.speak = function() {};
```

**Good:**
```javascript
class Animal {
    constructor(age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    move() {}
}

class Mammal extends Animal {
    constructor(age, furColor) {
        super(age);
        this.furColor = furColor;
    }

    liveBirth() {}
}

class Human extends Mammal {
    constructor(age, furColor, languageSpoken) {
        super(age, furColor);
        this.languageSpoken = languageSpoken;
    }

    speak() {}
}
```

### Use method chaining
Against the advice of Clean Code, this is one place where we will have to differ.
It has been argued that method chaining is unclean and violates the [Law of Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter).
Maybe it's true, but this pattern is very useful in JavaScript and you see it in
many libraries such as jQuery and Lodash. It allows your code to be expressive,
and less verbose. For that reason, I say, use method chaining and take a look at
how clean your code will be. In your class functions, simply return `this` at
the end of every function, and you can chain further class methods onto it.

**Bad:**
```javascript
class Car {
  constructor() {
    this.make = 'Honda';
    this.model = 'Accord';
    this.color = 'white';
  }

  setMake(make) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  setModel(model) {
    this.model = model;
  }

  setColor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  save() {
    console.log(this.make, this.model, this.color);
  }
}

let car = new Car();
car.setColor('pink');
car.setMake('Ford');
car.setModel('F-150')
car.save();
```

**Good**:
```javascript
class Car {
  constructor() {
    this.make = 'Honda';
    this.model = 'Accord';
    this.color = 'white';
  }

  setMake(make) {
    this.name = name;
    // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
    return this;
  }

  setModel(model) {
    this.model = model;
    // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
    return this;
  }

  setColor(color) {
    this.color = color;
    // NOTE: Returning this for chaining
    return this;
  }

  save() {
    console.log(this.make, this.model, this.color);
  }
}

let car = new Car()
  .setColor('pink')
  .setMake('Ford')
  .setModel('F-150')
  .save();
```

### Prefer composition over inheritance
As stated famously in the [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns),
you should prefer composition over inheritance where you can. There are lots of
good reasons to use inheritance and lots of good reasons to use composition.
The main point for this maxim is that if your mind instinctively goes for
inheritance, try to think if composition could model your problem better. In some
cases it can. Inheritance is great for preventing

You might be wondering then, "when should I use inheritance?" It
depends on your problem at hand, but this is a decent list of when inheritance
makes more sense than composition:

1. Your inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship and not a "has-a"
relationship (Animal->Human vs. User->UserDetails).
2. You can reuse code from the base classes (Humans can move like all animals).
3. You want to make global changes to derived classes by changing a base class.
(Change the caloric expenditure of all animals when they move).

**Bad:**
```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, email) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }

  // ...
}

// Bad because Employees "have" tax data. EmployeeTaxData is not a type of Employee
class EmployeeTaxData extends Employee {
  constructor(ssn, salary) {
    super();
    this.ssn = ssn;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  // ...
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
class Employee {
  constructor(name, email) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;

  }

  setTaxData(ssn, salary) {
    this.taxData = new EmployeeTaxData(ssn, salary);
  }
  // ...
}

class EmployeeTaxData {
  constructor(ssn, salary) {
    this.ssn = ssn;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  // ...
}
```

## **Concurrency**
### Use Promises, not callbacks
Callbacks aren't clean, and they cause excessive amounts of nesting. With ES6,
Promises are a built-in global type. Use them!

**Bad:**
```javascript
require('request').get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin', function(err, response) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
  else {
    require('fs').writeFile('article.html', response.body, function(err) {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
      } else {
        console.log('File written');
      }
    })
  }
})

```

**Good**:
```javascript
require('request-promise').get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin')
  .then(function(response) {
    return require('fs-promise').writeFile('article.html', response);
  })
  .then(function() {
    console.log('File written');
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.log(err);
  })

```

### Async/Await are even cleaner than Promises
Promises are a very clean alternative to callbacks, but ES7 brings async and await
which offer an even cleaner solution. All you need is a function that is prefixed
in an `async` keyword, and then you can write your logic imperatively without
a `then` chain of functions. Use this if you can take advantage of ES7 features
today!

**Bad:**
```javascript
require('request-promise').get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin')
  .then(function(response) {
    return require('fs-promise').writeFile('article.html', response);
  })
  .then(function() {
    console.log('File written');
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.log(err);
  })

```

**Good**:
```javascript
async function getCleanCodeArticle() {
  try {
    var request = await require('request-promise')
    var response = await request.get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin');
    var fileHandle = await require('fs-promise');

    await fileHandle.writeFile('article.html', response);
    console.log('File written');
  } catch(err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  }
```

## **Formatting**
Formatting is subjective. Like many rules herein, there is no hard and fast
rule that you must follow. The main point is DO NOT ARGUE over formatting.
There are [tons of tools](http://standardjs.com/rules.html) to automate this.
Use one! It's a waste of time and money for engineers to argue over formatting.

For things that don't fall under the purview of automatic formatting
(indentation, tabs vs. spaces, double vs. single quotes, etc.) look here
for some guidance.

### Use consistent capitalization
JavaScript is untyped, so capitalization tells you a lot about your variables,
functions, etc. These rules are subjective, so your team can choose whatever
they want. The point is, no matter what you all choose, just be consistent.

**Bad:**
```javascript
var DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
var daysInMonth = 30;

var songs = ['Back In Black', 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Hey Jude'];
var Artists = ['ACDC', 'Led Zeppelin', 'The Beatles'];

function eraseDatabase() {}
function restore_database() {}

class animal {}
class Alpaca {}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
var DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
var DAYS_IN_MONTH = 30;

var songs = ['Back In Black', 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Hey Jude'];
var artists = ['ACDC', 'Led Zeppelin', 'The Beatles'];

function eraseDatabase() {}
function restoreDatabase() {}

class Animal {}
class Alpaca {}
```

### Function callers and callees should be close
If a function calls another, keep those functions vertically close in the source
file. Ideally, keep the caller right above the callee. We tend to read code from
top-to-bottom, like a newspaper. Because of this, make your code read that way.

**Bad:**
```javascript
class PerformanceReview {
  constructor(employee) {
    this.employee = employee;
  }

  lookupPeers() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, 'peers');
  }

  lookupMananger() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, 'manager');
  }

  getPeerReviews() {
    let peers = this.lookupPeers();
    // ...
  }

  perfReview() {
      getPeerReviews();
      getManagerReview();
      getSelfReview();
  }

  getManagerReview() {
    let manager = this.lookupManager();
  }

  getSelfReview() {
    // ...
  }
}

let review = new PerformanceReview(user);
review.perfReview();
```

**Good**:
```javascript
class PerformanceReview {
  constructor(employee) {
    this.employee = employee;
  }

  perfReview() {
      getPeerReviews();
      getManagerReview();
      getSelfReview();
  }

  getPeerReviews() {
    let peers = this.lookupPeers();
    // ...
  }

  lookupPeers() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, 'peers');
  }

  getManagerReview() {
    let manager = this.lookupManager();
  }

  lookupMananger() {
    return db.lookup(this.employee, 'manager');
  }

  getSelfReview() {
    // ...
  }
}

let review = new PerformanceReview(employee);
review.perfReview();
```

## **Comments**
### Only comment things that have business logic complexity.
Comments are an apology, not a requirement. Good code *mostly* documents itself.

**Bad:**
```javascript
function hashIt(data) {
  // The hash
  var hash = 0;

  // Length of string
  var length = data.length;

  // Loop through every character in data
  for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    // Get character code.
    var char = i.charCodeAt(i);
    // Make the hash
    hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + char;
    // Convert to 32-bit integer
    hash = hash & hash;
  }
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript

function hashIt(data) {
  var hash = 0;
  var length = data.length;

  for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    var char = i.charCodeAt(i);
    hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + char;

    // Convert to 32-bit integer
    hash = hash & hash;
  }
}

```

### Don't leave commented code in your codebase
Version control exists for a reason. Leave old code in your history.

**Bad:**
```javascript
doStuff();
// doOtherStuff();
// doSomeMoreStuff();
// doSoMuchStuff();
```

**Good**:
```javascript
doStuff();
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Don't have journal comments
Remember, use version control! There's no need for dead code, commented code,
and especially journal comments. Use `git log` to get history!

**Bad:**
```javascript
/**
 * 2016-12-20: Removed monads, didn't understand them (RM)
 * 2016-10-01: Improved using special monads (JP)
 * 2016-02-03: Removed type-checking (LI)
 * 2015-03-14: Added combine with type-checking (JR)
 */
function combine(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Good**:
```javascript
function combine(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Avoid legal comments in source files
That's what your `LICENSE` file at the top of your source tree is for.

**Bad:**
